# Ethereum - Web 3 fullstack study

I'm now grouping some base information to start digging deeper into this.

## Key points:
- [ ] The programming language of ethereum is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).
- [ ] Ethereum has a web based IDE called [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- [ ] The communication is done with [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).
- [ ] [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript based API to interact with an ethereum node.

## Main standards
- [ ] [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is a standard for fungible tokens.
- [ ] [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) is a standard for NFTs.
- [ ] [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) Combines ERC20 + ERC-721 + batch operations.

## Dev Tools
- [ ] [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) to easily start.
- [ ] [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) for testing.
- [ ] [Infura](https://infura.io/) development suite
- [ ] [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) an alternative to web3js compatible with multiple blockchains
